Story:

Levels:
At least 3 levels.

Structure of the levels:
A level starts with a normal attack of enermies. A mid boss then shows up, and gives you a small challenge. Then some new other enermies show up. At the end a big boss shows up and is stronger than the mid boss, and has more lives.
There is dialogue between the level boss and the player.
