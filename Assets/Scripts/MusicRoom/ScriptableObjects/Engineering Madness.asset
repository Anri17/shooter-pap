  composerComment: 'When I composed this track, I didn''t really know what to think
    of it. At first it sounds like a playfull track, but it quickly picks up a more
    serious tune, followed by an epic melody.


    I gave this track to Mero because I think it fits with her personality quite nicely,
    where you can''t really predict what she''s thinking, so you can''t take her lightly
    either.'
