  composerComment: 'The Stage 1 Boss Theme.


    When I composed this track, I didn''t really know what to think of it. It starts
    playfull and happy, but it quickly picks up a more serious tone. I gave it to
    Mero because she''s being a prankster in this stage. I also hope it helps give
    the play a hint about her personality.'
